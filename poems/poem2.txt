The Silent Echoes

In quiet rooms where shadows dance,
And moonlight paints its silver trance,
The silent echoes softly speak,
Of promises we meant to keep.

Through corridors of memory's hall,
Where faded photographs recall,
The laughter shared, the tears we shed,
And all the words we left unsaid.

The clock ticks on, the moments flee,
Yet echoes stay for you and me,
In whispered winds and falling rain,
They speak of joy, they speak of pain.

So listen close when silence falls,
To echo's call within these walls,
For in the quiet, truth is found,
In every gentle, whispering sound.
