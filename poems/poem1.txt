Canvas of Dreams

Upon the canvas of the night,
We paint our dreams with starlight,
Each brushstroke bold, each color bright,
A masterpiece of pure delight.

With palette made of hopes and fears,
We paint through smiles and through tears,
Creating art through passing years,
That time itself reveres.

The blues of oceans, deep and wide,
The golden sun at eventide,
The crimson passion held inside,
On this canvas we confide.

So dip your brush in colors true,
And paint the dreams that live in you,
For every dream that comes anew,
Makes all your aspirations true.
